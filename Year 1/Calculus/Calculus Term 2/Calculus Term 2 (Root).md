# [[Series (Root)]]

A series is a sum of a sequence between two values, enjoy!
# [[Integration]]

You did this at A-level, but we made it *way* more complicated with all this notation
# [[Lagrange Multipliers]]

A cool way to min max a function when subject to the limits of another function
# [[Fourier Series]]

A cool way to represent a function using series' of trig functions. Cooler than Taylors series when your function is not **smooth**
