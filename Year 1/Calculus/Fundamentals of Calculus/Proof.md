# Proof by Contradiction

To prove a theorem $p$, we assume $\lnot p$ and show that $\lnot p\implies q$ where $q$ is known to be **false**. This means that it is not $\lnot p$ and therefore $p$
# Proof by Induction

Theorem: Statement $S(n)$ holds for all integers $n\geq a$
##### Base Case

Check that $S(a)$ is true
##### Induction Step

Prove that if $S(k)$ is true if we assume $S(k-1)$ is true

From this we conclude that $S(n)$ holds for $n=a$, therefore $n=a+1$ and so on. Meaning that $S(n)$ holds for all $n\geq a$
