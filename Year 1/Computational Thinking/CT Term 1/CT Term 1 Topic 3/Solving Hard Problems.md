3.3.2 - Dealing With NP-Hardness 

NP-hard problems can be solved via brute-force 

- Testing all possible instances and picking the best 
    
- This is bad because it often takes exponential or factorial time 
    

3.3.5 - Genetic Algorithms 

- Overcomes barrier of NP-hardness 
    
- Iteratively breeding solutions with more fitting solutions having a greater impact on the next generation
