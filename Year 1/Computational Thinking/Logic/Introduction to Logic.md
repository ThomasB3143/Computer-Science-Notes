Section: [[Logic (Root)]]

A logic is a formal language for making statements about objects, alongside a system for reasoning the properties of these objects.

It is used to carry out precise and rigorous arguments about assertions and proofs. It uses a language with unambiguous semantics and precise structure.

A logic also requires a system of deduction by which truths can be constructed (a proof system), as well as a notion of meaning by which the truth (or falsity) of a property can be determined

## Components of a Logic

- Syntax
	- The definition of the formulae of the logic
- Semantics
	- The association of meaning and truth to the formulae
- Proof system
	- The manipulation of formulae according to a system of rules

We want these components to make our logic complete (all the true formulae should be provable) and sound (all provable formulae should be true)
