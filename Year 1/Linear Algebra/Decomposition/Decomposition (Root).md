# [[LU-Decomposition]]

A complicated operation to decompose a matrix into a pair of lower diagonal and upper diagonal matrices
# [[Eigendecomposition]]

A way to decompose a matrix using eigenvectors (more information on these can be found in the corresponding linear algebra subsection)
# [[QR Decomposition]]

A decomposition method that makes it very easy to form [[Linear Regression]] models using the **Least squares** method
# [[Spectral Decomposition]]

The final, ultimate decomposition, using aspects of both QR and Eigendecomposition
