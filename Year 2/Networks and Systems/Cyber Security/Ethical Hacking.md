# Phases of Ethical Hacking
# Reconnaissance

- Gathering as much information as possible about the system
- Tools:
	- Nmap 
	- Whois
	- Maltego
- Techniques:
	- Network scanning
	- social engineering
- Take notes!
# Scanning

- Identifying open ports, active devices and services on the target network
- Tools:
	- Nessus
	- OpenVAS
	- Angry IP Scanner
	- nmap
	- Wireshark
- Techniques
	- Port scanning
	- Vulnerability scanning
	- Network mapping
	- Banner grabbing
	- Ping sweeps
# Gaining Access

- Using scanned vulnerabilities to gain unauthorised access to the target system
- Tools:
	- Metasploit
	- SQLmap
	- Hydra
- Techniques
	- Password cracking
	- Exploration of Vulnerability
	- SQL Injection
	- Buffer overflow
	- XSS
	- Privilege Escalation
	- Session hijacking
	- Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
# Maintaining Access

- Keeping a foothold in the target system to perform further actions
- Tools:
	- Netcat
	- Ngrok
	- Empire
- Techniques
	- Installing backdoors
	- Creating hidden users
	- SSH Tunneling
	- Keystroke logs
