## Algorithms

An algorithm is a method followed to solve a problem, with the following properties:

- Correctness
- Composed of concrete unambiguous steps
- Finite number of steps
- Always terminates
## Data Structures

A data structure is a method of storing and organising data in a computer to ensure efficiency
## Random Access Machine

A highly simplified model of computation used to compute the efficiency of an algorithm, where:

- Memory consists of an infinite array
- Instructions are executed sequentially one at a time
- All instruction take unit time. Running time is the number of instructions executed
