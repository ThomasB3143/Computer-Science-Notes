## Arrangements

Arrangements are a **finite** sequence of items with relevant **order**

Arrangements of a size $k$ on $n$ choices without repeats is $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
## Permutations

Permutations are an **arrangement** of a set, using **each** element once

Permutations of a set of size $n$ is $n!$

An r-permutation is an arrangement of \(r\) distinct elements from a set
$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
## Counting examples

Where A and B are two finite disjoint sets $A\cap B = \emptyset$, the cardinality of the union is the sum of the individual cardinalities
