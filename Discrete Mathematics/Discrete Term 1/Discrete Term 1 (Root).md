#Root #Root2 Section: [[Discrete Mathematics (Root)]] 
## [[Arrangements and Permutations]]

A guide to the terminology needed for the rest of the content in this term
## [[Combinations]]

A new way to select elements from a set! Applicable to most of discrete mathematics hence an essential fundamental
## [[Arrangements and Combinations with Repetitions]]

Building on the last two chapters, this section looks at some unique arrangements and combinations and how we can manipulate them
## [[Proofs]]

An introduction to three important methods of giving proof on a statement, induction, pigeon-hole and inclusion-exclusion
## [[Generating Functions]]

The pinnacle of first year discrete, the bridge between continuous and discrete mathematics that provides the tools needed to solve the toughest of problems
